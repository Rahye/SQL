Challenge: Book list database

What are your favorite books? You can make a database table to store them in! In this first step, create a table to store your list of books. 
It should have columns for id, name, and rating. Now, add three of your favorite books into the table.

/** Book list:
Milk and Honey (2)
Pillow Thoughts (5)
Pachinko (4)
**/

CREATE TABLE books (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, rating INTEGER );

INSERT INTO books VALUES (1, "Milk and Honey", 2);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (2, "Pillow Thoughts", 5);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (3, "Pachinkop", 4);

SELECT * FROM books;
